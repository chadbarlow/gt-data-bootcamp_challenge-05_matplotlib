<h1 align="left">MATPLOTLIB<br><i>Topic: Skin Cancer Treatment Analysis</i> </h1> 

<p>This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of various drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common skin cancer, using data from a recent animal study. We focused on comparing the performance of drug Capomulin against other treatment regimens.

## Data Science Tools
- Python
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Features
* Bar, pie, scatter, and box plots
* Correlation and regression analysis

## Conclusions
The analysis shows the effectiveness of the drug regimens in reducing tumor volume, their potential outliers, and the distribution of the final tumor volume for each treatment group. It also presents the relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

## Limitations
- The analysis is based on a single animal study with a limited number of mice.
- The study duration is 45 days, which might not be enough to draw long-term conclusions on treatment effectiveness.
- The analysis focuses only on tumor volume reduction and does not consider other factors that may affect treatment success.

## Further Analysis
1. Analyze additional studies to validate the findings.
2. Investigate the impact of other factors, such as age, weight, and genetic background, on the effectiveness of each treatment regimen.
3. Conduct a time-series analysis to assess the long-term effectiveness of the drug regimens.
